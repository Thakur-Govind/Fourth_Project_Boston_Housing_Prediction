This was my Fourth and Final Project of the first Machine Learning NanoDegree
This Project was heavily assisted by Udacity, However, the code is written by me
A lot of conceptual questions were kept for me to answer,
along with using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for a Decision Tree model, 
which was to be used for predicting House Prices.
This Project really strengthened my basic concepts of Machine Learning.
As this was done on Udacity's workspace, I am unable to get the Notebook.
However, I have the html copy of the project, which has been uploaded.
